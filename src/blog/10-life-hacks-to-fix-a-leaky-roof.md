Let’s face it, when your roof starts leaking, it can feel like the sky is literally falling. But don’t panic! With a little creativity, a dash of elbow grease, and some common household items, you can stop that annoying drip without shelling out a fortune. Here are 10 life hacks to fix a leaky roof without breaking the bank.

## 1. Plastic Tarp – Your New Best Friend

If you’ve got a leaky spot and a storm’s on the horizon, grab that old plastic tarp from the garage (or sneak one from your neighbor’s BBQ stash). Drape it over the leaky area and secure it with some heavy objects—bricks, sandbags, or whatever you have lying around.

* Cost: Free (unless you raid the neighbor’s BBQ, in which case, it’s a steak dinner)
* Savings: Hiring a professional to patch a leak? About $200 in Melbourne.

## 2. Buckets – The Unsung Heroes

We’ve all seen this classic trick in cartoons: place a bucket under the leak to catch the drips. It won’t fix the roof, but hey, it keeps the water off your floor while you plan your next move.

* Cost: Free (if you already own a bucket)
* Savings: Prevents damage to your hardwood floors, which could set you back $500 in repairs.

## 3. Duct Tape – The Miracle Fix-All

If your roof has small holes or cracks, bust out the duct tape. It’s not just for holding your car bumper in place anymore. While this is definitely a temporary fix, it’ll keep you dry for a while.

* Cost: $10 for a roll (you know you already have one in the junk drawer)
* Savings: Compared to a professional patch-up? That’s $300 in your pocket.

## 4. Sealant from Your Bathroom

Got some leftover sealant from that bathroom renovation? Use it to plug smaller cracks and leaks in your roof. A quick squirt of silicone sealant works wonders around chimneys, skylights, or any awkward angles where water sneaks in.

* Cost: Free (if you’ve got a half-used tube lying around)
* Savings: Roofers usually charge $250 just for sealing up these small leaks.

## 5. Aluminum Foil and a Staple Gun

Got a leaky shingle? Slap some aluminum foil over it and staple it down. Sure, it may look a bit like your roof is preparing for an alien invasion, but it’s waterproof, and it’ll hold for a while.

* Cost: Free (if you’ve been wrapping leftovers)
* Savings: A professional would charge around $400 to replace a section of shingles.

## 6. Use an Old Shower Curtain for Flashing

If you notice leaks around your roof flashing, replace the flashing with an old shower curtain cut to size. Use nails or adhesive to secure it. This might sound crazy, but it’ll hold up long enough to get through a few more rainy days.

* Cost: Free (assuming you have a spare shower curtain)
* Savings: Proper flashing repairs usually cost around $500 in Melbourne.

## 7. Cling Wrap and Rubber Bands for Skylights

Is your skylight leaking? Grab some cling wrap and rubber bands. Stretch the cling wrap over the skylight (make it as tight as possible) and secure it with the bands around the edges. You won’t get a sunbath, but it’ll stop the water.

* Cost: Free (if you’ve got leftovers from last night’s dinner)
* Savings: Fixing a leaky skylight can cost around $600, so you’ve saved big here.

## 8. Tennis Balls for Downspout Blockages

Clogged gutters can cause water to overflow and leak into your roof. Got a tennis ball? Tie it to a long string, drop it into the downspout, and work it back and forth to clear the blockage. Rainwater will flow freely again.

* Cost: Free (assuming you have an old tennis ball somewhere)
* Savings: Gutter cleaning costs around $150. Not bad for a 15-minute hack.

## 9. Waterproof Paint You Forgot About

Did you start painting the fence last summer and forget to finish? If you have leftover waterproof paint, use it to coat vulnerable areas of your roof, like old flashing or worn shingles. It’s not a permanent fix, but it’ll keep things dry until you’re ready for something more permanent.

* Cost: Free (if you have leftover paint)
* Savings: Roof coating costs around $700 in Melbourne.

## 10. DIY Roof Inspection with Binoculars

Sometimes, the best fix is prevention. Take a pair of binoculars (or your phone’s zoom feature) and inspect your roof from the ground. Spotting issues early can prevent costly leaks. No need for ladders or risking a fall!

* Cost: Free (because you’re not calling a professional)
* Savings: A professional roof inspection can cost up to $250. Plus, catching problems early can save thousands.
