Ah, gutters. Those magical, forgotten channels of your home that do their best to keep rainwater from turning your walls into a swampy disaster. And yet, how often do we actually clean them? If you’re anything like my neighbor Dave, the answer is: never. That is, until a family of parrots sets up a duplex in your downspout.

But fear not! Today, you’ll learn how to clean your gutters in just 20 minutes. That’s right, no full-day ordeal, no expensive gear—just you, a ladder, a few simple tools, and the willpower to conquer the leaves before they conquer you.

### Step 1: Gather Your Tools (and Your Courage)

Before we begin, let’s talk about what you’ll need:

* A **sturdy ladder** (not the wobbly one your uncle left in your garage in 1987)
* **Gloves** (unless you enjoy the feeling of wet, decomposing leaves in your hands)
* A **small trowel or scoop** (or, if you’re feeling primitive, just your hands)
* A **bucket or a tarp** (for collecting the debris)
* A **hose with a spray nozzle** (or, if you’re fancy, a pressure washer)
* **Eye protection** (because trust me, there’s nothing quite like a surprise splash of 3-year-old gutter sludge to the face)

Bonus: A dog. Not for cleaning purposes, but for moral support. My mate John tried cleaning his gutters last summer, and his dog, Bruno, sat at the bottom of the ladder, judging his every move. It helped.

### Step 2: Secure Your Ladder and Your Life

Ladders and gravity are not always friends. Find stable ground, place the ladder securely, and—this is important—**tell someone you’re cleaning the gutters**. If you live alone, tell your dog. At least Bruno will bark if you take an unexpected tumble.

### Step 3: Start Scooping

Now comes the fun part! Use your trowel (or hands, if you like living on the edge) to scoop out all the leaves, twigs, and mystery gunk from your gutters. Pro tip: If it moves, put it back and pretend you saw nothing.

### Step 4: Check the Downspouts

Once the gutters are cleared, check the downspouts. If they’re clogged, use your hose to blast out the debris. If water doesn’t flow freely, you might have to use a plumber’s snake or, as my friend Lisa did, poke it aggressively with a broomstick while muttering under her breath.

### Step 5: Rinse and Inspect

Use the hose to rinse out the gutters and make sure everything is flowing smoothly. If you notice leaks, congratulations! You now have a weekend project involving sealant and a few choice words.

### Step 6: Admire Your Work (and Take a Selfie)

Step back and look at your handiwork. This is the moment when you feel like a true homeowner. Take a picture, send it to your group chat, and expect at least one friend to say, “Wow, I should do that too.” (They won’t.)

### The Aftermath: What If You Don’t Clean Your Gutters?

Now, you might be wondering, *what happens if I just… don’t clean my gutters?* Well, here’s what:

* Water overflows, soaking your walls and foundation. (Congratulations, you now have an indoor pond.)
* Gutters sag and pull away from the house, turning into a high-end birdbath.
* Insects and small animals move in. (Do you really want to share your home with a wasp colony?)
* Your roof gets water damage, and suddenly you’re paying thousands for repairs instead of spending 20 minutes with a ladder.

### The Easy Way Out: Let the Pros Handle It
