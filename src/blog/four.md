## Introduction

As a professional interior and exterior painter in Melbourne, I’ve seen it all—rain, shine, and the occasional house that seemed to want to remain unpainted. Melbourne’s unpredictable weather, coupled with the quirky personalities of my clients, has led to some pretty memorable experiences. But one story stands out among the rest...

## The Mysterious Case of the Missing Paint

It was a sunny Tuesday morning in the suburb of Carlton, and I was starting a fresh coat on an old Victorian terrace. I had everything set: paint, brushes, rollers, and even my favorite hat that kept the sun out of my eyes. I was working on the exterior, giving the front of the house a nice fresh coat of white. Everything was going smoothly until lunchtime.

I left for a quick sandwich at a local café and returned, only to find...my paint was missing. Now, as a painter, this is akin to a chef returning to the kitchen to find the ingredients gone. I scratched my head, looked around the job site—no paint cans in sight. After a moment of confusion, I noticed something strange: the neighbor’s dog sitting next to an oddly splattered lawn.

Turns out, this furry little culprit had taken a keen interest in my open paint cans while I was away, knocking them over and painting a small masterpiece on the ground. It was a hilarious sight. I had to explain to the client why their neighbor’s lawn now had white patches, and fortunately, they saw the funny side of it. The lesson? Always close the paint cans, even if you think you're safe for a quick lunch break!

## The Perils of Exterior Painting in Melbourne

If you’re painting the exterior of a house in Melbourne, you’ve got to be prepared for anything. One minute it’s clear skies, and the next it’s pouring rain like you’ve suddenly found yourself in the middle of a downpour scene from a movie.

On another job in St Kilda, I learned the hard way just how fast Melbourne’s weather can turn. I was painting a bright blue feature wall outside, feeling like an artist creating a masterpiece. Just as I stepped back to admire my work, I felt the first drop. Before I could react, a torrential downpour started. By the time I scrambled to cover everything, the beautiful blue wall had turned into something that resembled an abstract watercolor painting. I call that “Melbourne Weather Art.”

## A Lesson Learned: Trust the Weather

I’ve learned that in Melbourne, you never trust a sunny day. Always check the weather app and then check it again. Melbourne’s weather is as unpredictable as a coin toss. On another occasion, I had almost finished a large exterior job when the weather suddenly decided it was time for wind. The wind blew so strongly that the paint went everywhere—except the walls. I spent the rest of the afternoon explaining to the homeowner why the garden furniture had a new accidental paint job.

## Takeaway for Homeowners

Painting in Melbourne is no easy task, especially when you’re dealing with the unpredictable elements and the occasional mischievous pet. Whether you’re tackling an interior or exterior job, make sure to:

1. Keep your paint cans closed when you’re not using them.
2. Always check the weather forecast before starting any exterior painting.
3. Be prepared for the unexpected—because Melbourne's weather has a sense of humor.

But don’t let that discourage you! A fresh coat of paint can completely transform your home, inside or out. Just make sure you have a professional by your side—or at least someone who knows how to handle sudden dog interventions and surprise weather events.

Happy painting!
